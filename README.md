Python: Data cleaning, EDA, modeling (Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)

Power BI: Advanced data visualization and dashboarding

🚀 Key Features
In-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on customer and service data

Predictive modeling using Logistic Regression and Random Forest to classify churn

Identification of high-risk cohorts (e.g., month-to-month contracts, electronic check payers, low-tenure customers)
